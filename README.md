### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
In this document, you can find some information about me.

I have always been interested in technology since my childhood. My aim was to become a software engineer, but I had to follow a different career path due to college exams. So I went to and graduated from the economics faculty.But pandemics and emerging socioeconomic developments changed my career plans. I decided to build a new career as a web developer.

Nowadays, I'm learning HTML and CSS. I follow Jonas Schmedtmann's course on Udemy, which I recommend to everyone who is a new starter. In the forthcoming weeks, I'm going to elaborate on what I have learned about HTML and CSS. I can load some projects onto a repository. And then I'm going to start learning Javascript and React JS. My road is long and hard, but I believe that I can cross it by virtue of persistence and curiosity.
