### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have always been interested in technology since my childhood. My aim was to become a software engineer, but I had to follow a different career path due to academic reasons. In that time, I was not good at advanced math and physics, so I went to and graduated from the economics faculty. But pandemics and emerging socioeconomic and personal developments in my life changed my career plans. I drop out my master program and joined Air Forces as Lieutenant for a year compulsory military service. 

After army I noticed that I do not want to work at a position that related my bachelorâ€™s degree. My experiences with recruitment specialists in job seeking process has been effective in this decision. I was a successful student in my department however, it had not fit for myself and personality and values in life. I do not want to hear anything about HR.

Therefore, I decided to turn over a new leaf in my life and build a new career as a software developer. I know that my road is long and hard, but I believe that I can cross it by my virtue of persistence and curiosity. Never too late for anything. I want to be born from ashes like Phoenix.
